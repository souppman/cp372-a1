# Design Notes for TCP Client-Server Implementation

## Server Design (server.py)

### Core Design Choices

1. **TCP Socket Implementation**
   - Used `socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM` for TCP communication
   - Reason: Requirement specified TCP only, provides reliable, ordered data delivery
   - Benefits: Ensures messages are received in order, handles connection management

2. **Threading Implementation**
   - Main Components:
     - One main thread for accepting connections
     - Separate thread per client (up to 3)
     - Thread lock for shared resources
   - Why Threading?
     - Allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously
     - Each client gets dedicated thread for message handling
     - Main thread stays free to accept new connections
   - Thread Safety:
     - Lock used for client counter
     - Lock used for client dictionary access
     - Prevents race conditions in shared resources

3. **In-Memory Cache Design**
   - Implementation:
     ```python
     self.clients = {
         client_id: {
             'socket': client_socket,
             'address': client_address,
             'start_time': start_time,
             'end_time': end_time
         }
     }
     ```
   - Why This Structure?
     - Meets requirement for in-memory only (no files)
     - Stores all required connection details
     - Easy to update and query
     - Efficient access by client ID

4. **Client Management**
   - Limited to 3 clients (configurable)
   - Client numbering system (Client01, Client02, etc.)
   - Connection tracking:
     - Start time recorded on connection
     - End time recorded on disconnection
     - Address stored for identification

5. **File Repository System (Bonus)**
   - Dedicated repository directory
   - File operations:
     - List files command
     - File content streaming
   - Error handling for missing files
   - Binary file handling capability

### Key Methods and Their Purpose

1. `__init__`
   - Initializes server configuration
   - Creates repository directory
   - Sets up socket with reuse address option

2. `handle_client`
   - Dedicated thread per client
   - Handles all client commands
   - Maintains client state
   - Manages clean disconnection

3. `get_client_status`
   - Thread-safe cache access
   - Formats connection information
   - Shows active and disconnected clients

4. `send_file`
   - Streams file contents
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Uses binary mode for compatibility

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Thread Synchronization**
   - Challenge: Race conditions when multiple clients accessed shared resources
   - Solution: Implemented thread locks for:
     - Client counter increments
     - Client dictionary updates
     - Status information access
   - Learning: Importance of identifying all shared resources early in design

2. **File Streaming**
   - Challenge: Determining when file transfer was complete
   - Challenge: Maintaining synchronization between file transfer and regular messaging
   - Solution: Implemented clear message boundaries and error handling
   - Learning: Need for robust protocol design in mixed-mode communication

3. **Client Disconnection**
   - Challenge: Handling unexpected client disconnections
   - Challenge: Ensuring proper resource cleanup
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive try-finally blocks
   - Learning: Importance of cleanup in multi-threaded environments

4. **Message Protocol**
   - Challenge: Distinguishing between different types of messages (chat vs. file content)
   - Challenge: Handling variable-length messages
   - Solution: Implemented clear command prefixes and response formats
   - Learning: Need for well-defined protocol specifications

### Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Features**
   - Implement client-to-client direct messaging
   - Add file upload capability to repository
   - Implement user authentication
   - Add chat rooms or groups
   - Support for larger files with progress indication

2. **Technical Improvements**
   - Use asyncio for better I/O handling
   - Implement message queuing for better scalability
   - Add configuration file for server settings
   - Implement logging system for better debugging
   - Add SSL/TLS for secure communication

3. **User Experience**
   - Add GUI interface option
   - Implement command history
   - Add file transfer progress bar
   - Support for rich text formatting
   - Add user presence indicators

## Client Design (client.py)

### Core Design Choices

1. **Socket Implementation**
   - Matches server's TCP implementation
   - Single socket for all communication
   - Synchronous communication model

2. **Command Line Interface**
   - Simple input/output design
   - Clear command structure
   - Formatted output for readability

3. **Error Handling**
   - Connection failures
   - Server full scenarios
   - Graceful exit handling
   - File transfer errors

4. **Message Processing**
   - Command parsing
   - Response handling
   - File content display
   - Status formatting

### Key Methods and Their Purpose

1. `__init__`
   - Establishes connection
   - Handles initial server communication
   - Sets up client identification

2. `send_message`
   - Main communication loop
   - Command handling
   - Response processing
   - Error management

3. `receive_file`

   - Formatted output

### Implementation Challenges

1. **File Content Display**

### Future Improvements

1. **Client Features**
